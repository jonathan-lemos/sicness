# sicness
A work-in-progress online SIC/XE assembler/debugger written in Typescript (ES6)/HTML/CSS.

## Features
### Assembler
* All SIC/XE instructions are supported.
* SIC Legacy instructions (*LDA) are supported.
* Outputs a complete .lst properly.
* The following compiler directives are supported:
    * START/END
    * RESW/RESB
	* WORD/BYTE
	* USE
	* BASE/NOBASE
* The following compiler directives are partially supported:
    * LTORG (does not place a new literal when out of pcrel/baserel range, fix AUTO-LTORG/LTORG-WORD)
	* EQU (does not interact with asterisk properly)
	* \* (does not interact with EQU properly)

### Website:
* Basic frontend complete (it looks awful).

## Roadmap
### Assembler:
* Add tests for SIC legacy operands and SicSpace instructions.
* Implement standalone executable script.
* Implement .obj format.
* Implement expression parser (BUFFERB - BUFFERA).
* Fix LTORG/EQU/\*
* Implement CSECT/ORG

### Website:
* Clean up the css/html so it doesn't look awful.
* Make a nicer looking frontend with React/Angular/Vue.
* Seperate output for .lst and .obj.
* Add a tabbed setup to switch between assembler and debugger.

### Debugger:
* Implement entire thing.
